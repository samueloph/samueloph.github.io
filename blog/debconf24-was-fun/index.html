<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://debconf24.debconf.org/">DebConf24</a> was fun!</p>
<p>A playlist of all of my talks, with subtitles (en, pt-br) and chapters is
available on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGG29PjeLnYeao03jWWH0eaRC5htIg1E&amp;si=3Hwrl5WHFFM2IaSO">YouTube</a>.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>DebConf24 was held in Busan, South Korea, between Sunday July 28th to Sunday August 4th 2024.</p>
<p>As usual for DebConfs, I had a great time meeting my friends, but also met new
people and got to learn a bit about the interesting things they're working on.</p>
<p>I ended up getting too excited during the talk submission stage of the
conference and as a result I presented 5 different activities (3 talks, 1 BoF
and 1 lightning talk).</p>
<p>Since I was too busy with the presentations, I did not have a lot of time to
actually hang out with folks, or even to go out in the city, I guess I've
learned my lesson for next time.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this post is to write about all of the things I presented
at the conference. I did want to list some of the interesting talks I've
watched, but that I would not be able to be fair as I'm sure I would miss some.</p>
<p>You can get the schedule and the recordings of any talks from the conference's website:
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://debconf24.debconf.org/schedule/">https://debconf24.debconf.org/schedule/</a></p>
<h1 id="wcurl-lightning-talk">wcurl Lightning Talk</h1>
<p>The most fun of my presentations, during the second-to-last day of the
conference, I've asked for help from Sergio Durigan Junior &lt;sergiodj&gt; to
setup an URL containing a whitespace and redirecting that to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://curl.se/wcurl/">wcurl</a>'s
manpage.</p>
<p>I then did a little demo to showcase why me (and a lot others) struggle
with downloading things with curl, and how <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://curl.se/wcurl/">wcurl</a> solves that.</p>

<h1 id="fixing-cves-on-debian-everything-you-probably-know-already">Fixing CVEs on Debian: Everything you probably know already</h1>
<p>I've always felt like DebConf was missing security-related talks, so I decided
to do something about it and presented a few of the things I've learned when
fixing CVEs for Debian.</p>
<p>This is an area where we don't get a lot of new contributors, I'm trying to
change that, and this talk can be used to introduce newcomers to it.</p>

<h1 id="the-secret-sauce-of-debian">The secret sauce of Debian</h1>
<p>Debian is not very vocal about all of the nice things it has regarding
quality-assurance, testing, or CI, even though it's at the state-of-the-art for
a lot of things.</p>
<p>This talk is an initial step towards making people aware of the cool
things happening behind the scenes. Ideally we should have it
well-documented somewhere.</p>

</p>
<h1 id="i-use-debian-btw-fzf-tmux-zoxide-and-friends">"I use Debian BTW": fzf, tmux, zoxide and friends</h1>
<p>One of my earliest good memories of Debian was when it started coming with a
colored PS1 by default, I still remember the feeling of relief whenever I
jumped into a Debian server and didn't have to deal with a black and white PS1.</p>
<p>There's still a lot of room for Debian to ship better defaults, and I think
some of them can actually happen.</p>
<p>This talk is a bit of a silly one where I'm just making people aware of the
existence of a few Golang/Rust CLI tools, and also some dotfiles configurations
that should probably be the default.</p>

</p>
<h1 id="curl">curl</h1>
<p>The curl project does such a great job with their security advisories that it
will likely never receive the amount of praise it deserves, but I did my best
at mentioning it throughout my <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzNVVILVyUM">CVEs talk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe I will write more extensively about this someday, but in case I don't:</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There's no other project which always consistently mentions the exact range of
commits that are affected by a given CVE.</p>
<p>Forget about whether the versions are EOL, curl doesn't have LTS releases, yet
they do such a great job at clearly documenting their CVEs that I would take
that over having LTS releases anytime (that's for curl at least, I
acknowledge some types of projects have a different need for LTS
releases).</p>
<p>Not only that, but they are also always careful about explaining alternative
mitigations such as configuration changes, build flags that defuse the
exploitation, or parameters that you should not use.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just like we tend to do every time we meet, me and the other Debian curl
maintainers spent the first 2 or 3 days of the conference talking about how we
wanted to eventually meet up to discuss the package.</p>
<p>It was going to be informal, maybe during the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://debconf24.debconf.org/about/cheese-and-wine-party/">Cheese and Wine
party</a>, but then
I've realized we should make it part of the official schedule, which would
also give us the recordings for later.</p>
<p>And so the "curl maintainers BoF" happened, where we spoke about HTTP3,
GnutTLS, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://curl.se/wcurl/">wcurl</a> and other things.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL7hSypUTdM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL7hSypUTdM</a>
<div class="yv">

</div>
</p>
<h1 id="wcurl">wcurl</h1>
<p>Right after that BoF, Daniel Stenberg
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://curl.se/mail/archive-2024-08/0000.html">asked</a> if we were interested
in having <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://curl.se/wcurl/">wcurl</a> adopted into curl, which we
definitely were, so <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/08/08/curl-welcomes-wcurl-to-the-team/">wcurl is now part of the curl
project</a>.</p>
<p>Daniel was also kind enough to design a logo for the project, which makes me
especially happy because I can stop with my own approach at a logo (which I had
to redo every few days):</p>
 <img src="wcurl_draft_logo.webp" alt="A laptop with a curl and a GoHorse
sticker, there&#x27;s a &#x27;w&#x27; handwritten with a marker on the right side of the curl
sticker, making it &#x27;wcurl&#x27;" width="700" height="699" loading="lazy" />
<p>And here is the new logo:</p>
 <img src="wcurl_logo.svg" alt="&#x27;wcurl&#x27; written with the same font and
colors as the curl logo, with the &#x27;w&#x27; being green instead of blue, and a
download icon at the end" width="998" height="250" loading="lazy" />
<p>Much better, I would say :)</p>
<h1 id="curl-swag">curl Swag</h1>
<p>DebConf24 was my chance at forwarding some curl swag items to the other
curl maintainers, so both Sergio Durigan Junior &lt;sergiodj&gt; and Carlos
Henrique Lima Melara &lt;charles&gt; got the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/05/06/i-survived-curl-up-2024">curl-up
t-shirt</a>
and the very cool <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/11/03/curl-coasters/">curl PCB
coaster</a>, both gifted
by Daniel Stenberg.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't have any of that for DebConf attendees, but I did drop
loads of curl stickers at the stickers table, they were gone very quickly.</p>
 <img src="debconf24_curl_stickers.webp" alt="A table full of different
stickers, curl stickers can be seen over the whole table" width="450" height="800" loading="lazy" />
<h1 id="for-the-future">For the future</h1>
<p>I used to think the most humbling experience you could have as someone who presented
a talk was to have to watch it yourself, you notice a lot of mistakes and
you instantly think about things that should be done differently.</p>
<p>It turns out the most humbling thing to do is actually to write subtitles for
your talks, I noticed every single mistake, often multiple times.</p>
<p>So after spending more than 30 hours writing the subtitles for both English and
Brazilian Portuguese for my talks, I feel like it's going to be much easier to
avoid committing the same mistakes again. After some time you stop feeling shame
about those mistakes and you're just left with feelings of annoyance, and at
that point it becomes easier to consciously avoid them.</p>
<p>I am collecting a list of things I wish I had done differently on all of those
talks, so if I end up presenting any one of them again, it will be an improved
version.</p>
