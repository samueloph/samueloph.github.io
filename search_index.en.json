   \n\ntl;dr\nWhenever you need to download files through the terminal and don't feel like using wget:\n\nManpage:\nhttps://curl.se/wcurl/manual.html\nAvailability (comes installed with the curl package):\n\nDebian unstable - Since 2024-07-02\nDebian testing - Since 2024-07-18\nDebian 12/bookworm-backports - Since 2024-08-25\nDebian 12/bookworm - Due to the way changes are planned for Debian Stable,\nwcurl will not be present in bookworm. Users are recommended to either manually\ndownload wcurl or use the bookworm-backports repository. wcurl will be present\nin Debian 13/trixie.\nDebian derivatives - Rolling releases will get it by the time it's on Debian\ntesting (e.g.: Kali Linux). Stable derivatives only in their next major release.\n\nIf you don't want to wait for the package update to arrive, you can always copy\nthe script and place it in your /usr/bin:\n\nAfter this announcement, wcurl has joined the curl organization:\nhttps://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/08/08/curl-welcomes-wcurl-to-the-team/\nProject homepage:\nhttps://curl.se/wcurl/\nSmoother CLI experience\nStarting with curl version 8.8.0-2, the Debian's curl package now ships a wcurl\nexecutable.\nwcurl is the solution for those who just need to download files without having\nto remember curl's parameters for things like automatically naming the files.\nSome people, myself included, would fall back to using wget whenever there was a\nneed to download a file. Sometimes even installing wget just for that usecase.\nAfter all, it's easier to remember \"apt install wget\" rather than \"curl -L -O -C - ...\".\nwcurl consists of a simple shell script that provides sane defaults for the curl\ninvocation, for when the use case is to just download files.\nBy default, wcurl will:\n\n\nPercent-encode whitespaces in URLs;\nDownload multiple URLs in parallel if the installed curl's version is &gt;= 7.66.0;\nFollow redirects;\nAutomatically choose a filename as output;\nAvoid overwriting files if the installed curl's version is &gt;= 7.83.0 (--no-clobber);\nPerform retries;\nSet the downloaded file timestamp to the value provided by the server, if available;\nDisable curl's URL globbing parser so {} and [] characters in URLs are not treated specially;\nPercent-decode the resulting filename;\nUse \"index.html\" as default filename if there's none in the URL.\n\n\nExample to download a single file:\n\nIf you ever need to set a custom flag, you can make use of the --curl-options\nwcurl option, anything set there will be passed to the curl invocation.\nJust beware that if you need to set any custom flags, it's likely you will be\nbetter served by calling curl directly. The --curl-options option is there to\nallow for some flexibility in unforeseen circumstances.\nThe need for wcurl\nI've always felt a bit ashamed of not remembering curl's parameters for\ndownloading a file and automatically naming it, having resorted to wget most of\nthe times this was needed (even installing wget when it wasn't there, just for\nthis). I've spoken to a few other experienced people I know and confirmed what\ncould be obvious to others: a lot of people struggle with this.\nRecently, the curl project released the results of 2024's curl\nsurvey, which\nalso showed this is as a much needed feature, just look at some of the answers:\nQ: Which curl command line option do you think needs improvement and how?\n\n-O, I really want wget like functionality where I don't have to specify the name\n\n\nDownloading a file (like wget) could be improved - with automatic naming of the file\n\n\ndownloading files - wget is much cleaner\n\n\nI wish the default behaviour when GETting a binary was to drop it on disk. That's the only\nreason 'wget foo.tgz\" is still ingrained in my muscle memory .\n\n\nMaybe have a way to download without specifying something in -o (the only reason i used wget\nstill)\n\n\n--remote-time should be default\n\n\n--remote-name-all could really use a short flag\n\nQ: If you miss support for something, tell us what!\n\n\"Write the data to the file named in the URL (or in redirects if I'm feeling daring), and\ntimestamp the file to the last-modified-date\". This is the main reason I'm still using wget.\n\nI can finally feel less bad about falling back to wget due to not remembering the\nparameters I want.\nIdealization vs. reality\nI don't believe curl will ever change its default behavior in such a way that\nwould accommodate this need, as that would have a side-effect of breaking things\nwhich expect the current behavior (the blast radius is literally the\nsolar system).\nThis means a new executable needs to be shipped side-by-side with curl, an\nopportunity to start fresh and work with a more focused use case (to download\nfiles).\nIdeally, this new executable would be maintained by the curl project, make use\nof libcurl under-the-hood, and be available everywhere. Nobody wants to worry\nif their systems have the tool or not, it should always be there.\nGiven I'm just a Debian Developer, with not as much free time as I wish, I've\ndecided to write a simple shell script wrapper calling the curl CLI\nunder-the-hood.\nwcurl will come installed with the curl package from now on, and I will check\nwith the release team about shipping it on the current Debian stable as well.\nShipping wcurl in other distros will be up to them (Debian-derivatives should\npick it up automatically, though).\nWe've tried to make it easy for anyone to ship this by using the curl license,\nkeeping the script POSIX-compliant, and shipping a manpage.\nMaybe if there's enough interest across distributions, someone might sign up\nfor implementing this in upstream curl and increase its reach. I would be happy\nwith the curl project reusing the wcurl name when that happens. It's unlikely\nthat wcurl would be shipped by curl upstream as it is, assuming they would\nprefer a solution that uses libcurl direclty (more similar to curl the CLI, to\nmaintain).\nIn the worst case, wcurl becomes a Debian-specific tool that only a few people\nare aware of, in the best case, it becomes the new go-to CLI tool for simply\ndownloading files. I would be happy if at least someone other than me finds\nit useful.\nNaming is hard\nWhen I started working on it, I was calling the new executable \"curld\"\n(stands for \"curl download\"), but then when discussing this in one of our\nweekly calls in the Debian Brasília community, it was mentioned that this could\nbe confused for a daemon.\nWe then settled for the name \"wcurl\", suggested by Carlos Henrique Lima\nMelara &lt;charles&gt;. It doesn't really stand for anything,\nbut it's very easy to remember.\nYou know... \"it's that wget alternative for when you want to use curl instead\"\n:)\nFeedback\nThe code is hosted in GitHub, feel free to open an issue to provide feedback.\nhttps://github.com/curl/wcurl\nWe also have a Matrix room for the Debian curl maintainers:\nhttps://matrix.to/#/#debian-curl-maintainers:matrix.org\nAcknowledgments\nThe idea for wcurl came a few days before the curl-up conference\n2024.\nI've been thinking a lot about developer productivity in the terminal lately,\ndifferent tools and better defaults. Before curl-up, I was also thinking about\npackaging improvements for the curl package. I don't remember what exactly\nhappened, but I likely had to download something and felt a bit ashamed of\nmaintaining curl and not remembering the parameters to download files the way I\nwanted.\nI first discussed this idea in the conference, where I asked the\nparticipants about it and there were no concerns raised, and some people said I should give it a go.\nParticipating in curl-up was a really great experience and I'm thankful for the\ninteractions I've had there.\nOn the Debian side, I've got reviews of the code and manpage by Sergio Durigan\nJunior &lt;sergiodj&gt;, Guilherme Puida Moreira &lt;puida&gt; and Carlos Henrique Lima\nMelara &lt;charles&gt;. Sergio ended up rewriting the tool to be POSIX-compliant (my\nversion was written in bash), so he takes all the credit for the portability.\nChanges since publication\n2025-01-19\n\nMention that wcurl will not be added to Debian 12/bookworm, it will be\npresent in Debian 13/trixie.\n\n2024-12-14\n\nUpdate list of wcurl features.\nPoint out to wcurl homepage and mention that it's now part of curl.\nReorder this changelog to have latest changes on top.\n\n2024-08-28\n\nMention availability in bookworm-backports.\nLink to wcurl lightning talk from DebConf24.\n\n2024-07-18\n\nUpdate date of availability for Debian testing and expected date for bookworm backports.\nMention charles as the person who suggested \"wcurl\" as a name.\nUpdate wcurl's -o/--opts options, it's now just --curl-options.\nRemove mention of language spoken in the Matrix room, we are using English now.\nUpdate list of features of wcurl.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://samueloph.dev/blog/announcing-wcurl-a-curl-wrapper-to-download-files/","title":"Announcing wcurl: a curl wrapper to download files"},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debconf24-was-fun/":{"body":" \n\ntl;dr\nDebConf24 was fun!\nA playlist of all of my talks, with subtitles (en, pt-br) and chapters is\navailable on YouTube.\nOverview\nDebConf24 was held in Busan, South Korea, between Sunday July 28th to Sunday August 4th 2024.\nAs usual for DebConfs, I had a great time meeting my friends, but also met new\npeople and got to learn a bit about the interesting things they're working on.\nI ended up getting too excited during the talk submission stage of the\nconference and as a result I presented 5 different activities (3 talks, 1 BoF\nand 1 lightning talk).\nSince I was too busy with the presentations, I did not have a lot of time to\nactually hang out with folks, or even to go out in the city, I guess I've\nlearned my lesson for next time.\nThe main purpose of this post is to write about all of the things I presented\nat the conference. I did want to list some of the interesting talks I've\nwatched, but that I would not be able to be fair as I'm sure I would miss some.\nYou can get the schedule and the recordings of any talks from the conference's website:\nhttps://debconf24.debconf.org/schedule/\nwcurl Lightning Talk\nThe most fun of my presentations, during the second-to-last day of the\nconference, I've asked for help from Sergio Durigan Junior &lt;sergiodj&gt; to\nsetup an URL containing a whitespace and redirecting that to wcurl's\nmanpage.\nI then did a little demo to showcase why me (and a lot others) struggle\nwith downloading things with curl, and how wcurl solves that.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM8M5qa4pPM\n\n    \n\n\nFixing CVEs on Debian: Everything you probably know already\nI've always felt like DebConf was missing security-related talks, so I decided\nto do something about it and presented a few of the things I've learned when\nfixing CVEs for Debian.\nThis is an area where we don't get a lot of new contributors, I'm trying to\nchange that, and this talk can be used to introduce newcomers to it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzNVVILVyUM\n\n    \n\n\nThe secret sauce of Debian\nDebian is not very vocal about all of the nice things it has regarding\nquality-assurance, testing, or CI, even though it's at the state-of-the-art for\na lot of things.\nThis talk is an initial step towards making people aware of the cool\nthings happening behind the scenes. Ideally we should have it\nwell-documented somewhere.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_X2IBnpjic\n\n    \n\n\n\"I use Debian BTW\": fzf, tmux, zoxide and friends\nOne of my earliest good memories of Debian was when it started coming with a\ncolored PS1 by default, I still remember the feeling of relief whenever I\njumped into a Debian server and didn't have to deal with a black and white PS1.\nThere's still a lot of room for Debian to ship better defaults, and I think\nsome of them can actually happen.\nThis talk is a bit of a silly one where I'm just making people aware of the\nexistence of a few Golang/Rust CLI tools, and also some dotfiles configurations\nthat should probably be the default.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfto3Seokn4\n\n    \n\n\ncurl\nThe curl project does such a great job with their security advisories that it\nwill likely never receive the amount of praise it deserves, but I did my best\nat mentioning it throughout my CVEs talk.\nMaybe I will write more extensively about this someday, but in case I don't:\n\nThere's no other project which always consistently mentions the exact range of\ncommits that are affected by a given CVE.\nForget about whether the versions are EOL, curl doesn't have LTS releases, yet\nthey do such a great job at clearly documenting their CVEs that I would take\nthat over having LTS releases anytime (that's for curl at least, I\nacknowledge some types of projects have a different need for LTS\nreleases).\nNot only that, but they are also always careful about explaining alternative\nmitigations such as configuration changes, build flags that defuse the\nexploitation, or parameters that you should not use.\n\nJust like we tend to do every time we meet, me and the other Debian curl\nmaintainers spent the first 2 or 3 days of the conference talking about how we\nwanted to eventually meet up to discuss the package.\nIt was going to be informal, maybe during the Cheese and Wine\nparty, but then\nI've realized we should make it part of the official schedule, which would\nalso give us the recordings for later.\nAnd so the \"curl maintainers BoF\" happened, where we spoke about HTTP3,\nGnutTLS, wcurl and other things.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL7hSypUTdM\n\n    \n\n\nwcurl\nRight after that BoF, Daniel Stenberg\nasked if we were interested\nin having wcurl adopted into curl, which we\ndefinitely were, so wcurl is now part of the curl\nproject.\nDaniel was also kind enough to design a logo for the project, which makes me\nespecially happy because I can stop with my own approach at a logo (which I had\nto redo every few days):\n \n\nAnd here is the new logo:\n \n\nMuch better, I would say :)\ncurl Swag\nDebConf24 was my chance at forwarding some curl swag items to the other\ncurl maintainers, so both Sergio Durigan Junior &lt;sergiodj&gt; and Carlos\nHenrique Lima Melara &lt;charles&gt; got the curl-up\nt-shirt\nand the very cool curl PCB\ncoaster, both gifted\nby Daniel Stenberg.\nUnfortunately I didn't have any of that for DebConf attendees, but I did drop\nloads of curl stickers at the stickers table, they were gone very quickly.\n \n\nFor the future\nI used to think the most humbling experience you could have as someone who presented\na talk was to have to watch it yourself, you notice a lot of mistakes and\nyou instantly think about things that should be done differently.\nIt turns out the most humbling thing to do is actually to write subtitles for\nyour talks, I noticed every single mistake, often multiple times.\nSo after spending more than 30 hours writing the subtitles for both English and\nBrazilian Portuguese for my talks, I feel like it's going to be much easier to\navoid committing the same mistakes again. After some time you stop feeling shame\nabout those mistakes and you're just left with feelings of annoyance, and at\nthat point it becomes easier to consciously avoid them.\nI am collecting a list of things I wish I had done differently on all of those\ntalks, so if I end up presenting any one of them again, it will be an improved\nversion.\n \n\n\nPhotography: Aigars Mahinovs &lt;aigaruius@debian.org&gt;\nLicense: CC-BYv3+ or GPLv2+\n","description":"","id":"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debconf24-was-fun/","title":"DebConf24 was fun! Security, curl, wcurl, Debian's quality"},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debian-13-my-list-of-exciting-new-features/":{"body":" \n\nBeyond Debian: Useful for other distros too\nEvery two years Debian releases a new major version of its Stable series,\nmeaning the differences between consecutive Debian Stable releases represent\ntwo years of new developments both in Debian as an organization and its native\npackages, but also in all other packages which are also shipped by other\ndistributions (which are getting into this new Stable release).\nIf you're not paying close attention to everything that's going on all the time\nin the Linux world, you miss a lot of the nice new features and tools. It's\ncommon for people to only realize there's a cool new trick available only years\nafter it was first introduced.\nGiven these considerations, the tips that I'm describing will eventually be\navailable in whatever other distribution you use, be it because it's a Debian\nderivative or because it just got the same feature from the upstream project.\nI'm not going to list \"passive\" features (as good as they can be), the focus\nhere is on new features that might change how you configure and use your\nmachine, with a mix between productivity and performance.\nDebian 13 - Trixie\nI have been a Debian Testing user for longer than 10 years now (and I recommend\nit for non-server users), so I'm not usually keeping track of all the cool\nfeatures arriving in the new Stable releases because I'm continuously receiving\nthem through the Debian Testing rolling release.\nNonetheless, as a Debian Developer I'm in a good position to point out the ones\nI can remember. I would also like other Debian Developers to do the same as I'm\nsure I would learn something new.\nThe Debian 13 release notes contain a \"What's new\" section\n, which\nlists the first two items here and a few other things, in other words, take my\nlist as an addition to the release notes.\nDebian 13 was released on 2025-08-09, and these are nice things you shouldn't\nmiss in the new release, with a bonus one not tied to the Debian 13 release.\n1) wcurl\n \n\nHave you ever had to download a file from your terminal using curl and didn't\nremember the parameters needed? I did.\nNowadays you can use wcurl; \"a command line tool which lets you download URLs\nwithout having to remember any parameters.\"\nSimply call wcurl with one or more URLs as parameters and it will download\nall of them in parallel, performing retries, choosing the correct output file\nname, following redirects, and more.\nTry it out:\n\nwcurl comes installed as part of the curl package on Debian 13 and in any other\ndistribution you can imagine, starting with curl 8.14.0.\nI've written more about wcurl in its release\nannouncement\nand I've done a lightning talk presentation in DebConf24, which is linked in\nthe release announcement.\n2) HTTP/3 support in curl\nDebian has become the first stable Linux distribution to ship curl with support\nfor HTTP/3. I've written about this in July\n2024, when we\nfirst enabled it. Note that we first switched the curl CLI to GnuTLS, but then\nended up releasing the curl CLI linked with OpenSSL (as support arrived later).\nDebian was the first stable Linux distro to enable it, and within\nrolling-release-based distros; Gentoo enabled it first in their non-default\nflavor of the package and Arch Linux did it three months before we pushed it to\nDebian Unstable/Testing/Stable-backports, kudos to them!\nHTTP/3 is not used by default by the curl CLI, you have to enable it with\n--http3 or --http3-only.\nTry it out:\n\n3) systemd soft-reboot\nStarting with systemd v254, there's a new soft-reboot option, it's an\nuserspace-only reboot, much faster than a full reboot if you don't need to\nreboot the kernel.\nYou can read the announcement from the systemd v254 GitHub\nrelease\nTry it out:\n\n4) apt --update\nAre you tired of being required to run sudo apt update just before sudo apt upgrade or sudo apt install $PACKAGE? So am I!\nThe new --update option lets you do both things in a single command:\n\nI love this, but it's still not yet where it should be, fingers crossed for a\nsimple apt upgrade to behave like other package managers by updating its\ncache as part of the task, maybe in Debian 14?\nTry it out:\n\nThis is especially handy for container usage, where you have to update the apt\ncache before installing anything, for example:\n\n5) powerline-go\npowerline-go is a powerline-style prompt written in Golang, so it's much more\nperformant than its Python alternative powerline.\npowerline-style prompts are quite useful to show things like the current status\nof the git repo in your working directory, exit code of the previous command,\npresence of jobs in the background, whether or not you're in an ssh session,\nand more.\n \n\nTry it out:\n\nThen add this to your .bashrc:\n\nOr this to .zshrc:\n\nIf you'd like to have your prompt start in a newline, like I have in the\nscreenshot above, you just need to set -newline in the powerline-go\ninvocation in your .bashrc/.zshrc.\n6) Gnome System Monitor Extension\nTips number 6 and 7 are for Gnome users.\nGnome is now shipping a system monitor extension which lets you get a glance of\nthe current load of your machine from the top bar.\n \n\nI've found this quite useful for machines where I'm required to install\nthird-party monitoring software that tends to randomly consume more resources\nthan it should. If I feel like my machine is struggling, I can quickly glance\nat its load to verify if it's getting overloaded by some process.\nThe extension is not as complete as\nsystem-monitor-next,\nnot showing temperatures or histograms, but at least it's officially part of\nGnome, easy to install and supported by them.\nTry it out:\n\nAnd then enable the extension from the \"Extension Manager\" application.\n7) Gnome setting for battery charging profile\nAfter having to learn more about batteries in order to get into FPV drones,\nI've come to have a bigger appreciation for solutions that minimize the\ninevitable loss of capacity that accrues over time.\nThere's now a \"Battery Charging\" setting (under the \"Power\") section which lets\nyou choose between two different profiles: \"Maximize Charge\" and \"Preserve\nBattery Health\".\n \n\nOn supported laptops, this setting is an easy way to set thresholds for when\ncharging should start and stop, just like you could do it with the tlp package,\nbut now from the Gnome settings.\nTo increase the longevity of my laptop battery, I always keep it at \"Preserve\nBattery Health\" unless I'm traveling.\nWhat I would like to see next is support for choosing different \"Power Modes\"\nbased on whether the laptop is plugged-in, and based on the battery\ncharge percentage.\nThere's a GNOME\nissue\ntracking this feature, but there's some pushback on whether this is the right\nthing to expose to users.\nIn the meantime, there are some workarounds mentioned in that issue which\npeople who really want this feature can follow.\nIf you would like to learn more about batteries; Battery\nUniversity is a great starting point, besides\ngetting into FPV drones and being forced to handle batteries without a Battery\nManagement System (BMS).\nAnd if by any chance this sparks your interest in FPV drones, Joshua Bardwell's\nYouTube channel is a great resource:\n@JoshuaBardwell.\n8) Lazygit\nEmacs users are already familiar with the legendary magit; a terminal-based\nUI for git.\nLazygit is an alternative for non-emacs users, you can integrate it with neovim\nor just use it directly.\nI'm still playing with lazygit and haven't integrated it into my workflows,\nbut so far it has been a pleasant experience.\n \n\nYou should check out the demos from the lazygit GitHub\npage.\nTry it out:\n\nAnd then call lazygit from within a git repository.\n9) neovim\nneovim has been shipped in Debian since 2016, but upstream has been doing a lot of\nwork to improve the experience out-of-the-box in the last couple of years.\nIf you're a neovim poweruser, you're likely not installing it from the official\nrepositories, but for those that are, Debian 13 comes with version 0.10.4,\nwhich brings the following improvements compared to the version in Debian 12:\n\n\nTreesitter support for C, Lua, Markdown, with the possibility of adding any\nother languages as needed;\n\n\nBetter spellchecking due to treesitter integration (spellsitter);\n\n\nMouse support enabled by default;\n\n\nCommenting support out-of-the-box;\nCheck :h commenting for details, but the\ntl;dr is that you can use gcc to comment the current line and gc to comment\nthe current selection.\n\n\nOSC52 support.\nEspecially handy for those using neovim over an ssh\nconnection, this protocol lets you copy something from within the neovim\nprocess into the clipboard of the machine you're using to connect through ssh.\nIn other words, you can copy from neovim running in a host over ssh and paste\nit in the \"outside\" machine.\n\n\n10) [Bonus] Running old Debian releases\nThe bonus tip is not specific to the Debian 13 release, but something I've\nrecently learned in the #debian-devel IRC channel.\nDid you know there are usable container images for all past Debian releases?\nI'm not talking \"past\" as in \"some of the older releases\", I'm talking past as\nin \"literally every Debian release, including the very first one\".\nTianon Gravi \"tianon\" is the Debian Developer responsible for making this\nhappen, kudos to him!\nThere's a small gotcha that the releases Buzz (1.1) and Rex (1.2) require a\n32-bit host, otherwise you will get the error Out of virtual memory!, but\nstarting with Bo (1.3) all should work in amd64/arm64.\nTry it out:\n\nDon't be surprised when noticing that apt/apt-get is not available inside the\ncontainer, that's because apt first appeared in Debian Slink (2.1).\nChanges since publication\n2025-08-30\n\nMention that Arch also enabled HTTP/3.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debian-13-my-list-of-exciting-new-features/","title":"Debian 13: My list of exciting new features"},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debian-curl-now-supports-http3/":{"body":"tl;dr\nStarting with curl 8.0.0-2, you can now use HTTP3.\n\nOr, if you would like to try it out in a container:\n\n(in case you haven't noticed, apt now has the --update option for the\nupgrade and install commands, although not available on stable yet)\nAvailability\n\nDebian unstable - Since 2024-07-02\nDebian testing - Since 2024-07-18\nDebian 12/bookworm-backports - Since 2024-08-25\nDebian 12/bookworm - Due to the mechanisms we have in place to make sure\nDebian stable is in fact stable, we will never be able to ship this in the\nregular repository. Users can make use of the\nbackports repositories instead.\nDebian derivatives - Rolling releases will get it by the time it's on Debian\ntesting (e.g.: Kali Linux). Stable derivatives only in their next major release.\n\nThe challenge\nHTTP3 is fresh new, well... not really, but at least fresh enough that I'm not\naware of any other Linux distribution supporting it on curl, the reason is\nlikely two-fold:\n\nOpenSSL is not there yet\nOpenSSL still doesn't have proper HTTP3 support, and given that OpenSSL is so\nwidely used, almost every curl distributor/packager will build curl with it\nand thus changing the TLS backend to something else is risky.\nUnfortunately, proper support for the OpenSSL libcurl is unlikely to come anytime\nbefore the end of this year, the OpenSSL performance is not good enough\nyet as of version 3.3.\nDaniel Stenberg has written about the state of this multiple times, most\nrecently at HTTP/3 in curl mid\n2024, if\nyou're interested, I suggest reading through his other posts as well.\nSome might have noticed that nginx does support HTTP3 through OpenSSL,\nalthough when you look closely, it's not exactly perfect:\n\nAn SSL library that provides QUIC support is recommended to build nginx, such as BoringSSL, LibreSSL, or QuicTLS. Otherwise, the OpenSSL compatibility layer will be used that does not support early data.\n\nAs you can see, they don't recommend using OpenSSL, and when doing so, you don't get complete support.\n\nHTTP3 support for GnuTLS/nghttp3/ngtcp2 is recent\nThe non-experimental support arrived back in October\n2023,\nand so that's when I started seriously planning for this.\ncurl has been working on HTTP3 support for years, and so it did support other\nTLS backends before that, but out of them, the one most feasible for a\ndistribution to ship would be GnuTLS, which gets HTTP3 support through ngctp2 and\nnghttp3.\n\n\nHow it was done\nThe Debian curl package has historically shipped at least two variants of libcurl, an\nOpenSSL and a GnuTLS one.\nThe OpenSSL libcurl can't support HTTP3 for the reasons explained above, but\nthe GnuTLS libcurl can (with ngtcp2 and nghtp3).\nDebian packages can choose which version of libcurl to link against (without\nhaving to modify any upstream source code). Debian's \"git\" package being a famous\nexample of a package that links against the GnuTLS libcurl.\nEnabling HTTP3 on curl was done in three steps:\n\nMake sure all required dependencies fulfill the minimum requirements.\nEnable HTTP3 for GnuTLS libcurl.\nChange the libcurl used by the curl CLI, from OpenSSL to GnuTLS.\n\ncurl's HTTP3 support requires a somewhat recent version of nghttp3 and\nupdating that required a transition (due to the SONAME bump), while we've also\nhad months of freeze for transitions due to the time_t\ntransition.\nAfter the dependencies were in place, enabling HTTP3 for the GnuTLS libcurl was\nstraightforward.\nThen, for the last part, we had to switch the TLS backend used by the curl CLI.\nDoing the swap is also quite\neasy\non the packaging level, but we have to consider the chances of this change\nbreaking our users' environments.\nEnsuring there are no breakages\nThe first thing to consider regarding breakages is that this change is not\ngoing to be pushed directly to the current Debian stable releases, it will be\npresent in the next stable release (13/trixie) but the current one will stick to the\nversion that's already shipped.\nSecondly, we have to consider the risk of losing the ability to use certain\nparameters from the curl CLI which could be limited to the OpenSSL backend.\nDuring curl-up 2024, the curl developers pointed out the existence of a page\nthat lists the TLS related options and the backends they work\nwith.\nAnalysing that page, ignoring all of the options that are suffixed with \"BLOB\"\n(only pertinent to the library, not the CLI), the only one left which is\nattention worthy is CURLOPT_ECH.\n\nThis experimental feature requires a special build of OpenSSL, as ECH is not\nyet supported in OpenSSL releases. In contrast ECH is supported by the latest\nBoringSSL and wolfSSL releases.\n\nAs it turns out, Encrypted Client Hello is experimental and it's not\nsupported by the vanilla OpenSSL.\nThis was enough of an investigation for me to go ahead with the change. Noting\nthat even in the worst case scenario (we find a horrible regression), we can\nrollback without having affected a single stable release.\nNow that the package is on Debian unstable, the CI tests (autopkgtest) of every\npackage that depends on curl is currently running, the results are compared\nagainst the migration-reference (in this case, the curl CLI with OpenSSL,\nbefore the change).\nIf everything goes right, curl with HTTP3 support will migrate to Debian\ntesting in around 5 days. If we spot any issues, we'll have to solve them\nfirst and it's going to be hard to predict how long it takes, although it's\nfair to expect less than a month.\nFeedback\nFeel free to join the Matrix room for the Debian curl maintainers:\nhttps://matrix.to/#/#debian-curl-maintainers:matrix.org\nAcknowledgements\nIt took us a bit longer than expected to be able to enable HTTP3, nonetheless it's\nstill early enough to be excited about.\nA lot of people were crucial to make this happen.\nI should recognize in the first place, obviously, the curl developers and the\ndevelopers of the supporting libraries: GnuTLS, nghttp3, ngtcp2. Participating\nin the curl-up\n2024\nconference helped me get motivated to push this through, besides becoming aware\nof the right documentation to research for impact.\nOn the Debian side, Sakirnth Nagarasa &lt;sakirnth&gt; was responsible for updating\nand taking care of the transition for nghttp3 and ngtcp2.\nAlso on the Debian side, I've got loads of help and support from the\nco-maintainers of the curl package: Sergio Durigan Junior &lt;sergiodj&gt; and Carlos\nHenrique Lima Melara &lt;charles&gt;.\nChanges since publication\n2025-03-08\n\nFix podman command, the previous one was not running all commands inside the container.\nChange the podman command to use Debian testing instead of unstable.\n\n2024-08-28\n\nMention availability in bookworm-backports.\n\n2024-07-18\n\nUpdate date of availability for Debian testing and expected date for bookworm-backports.\nRemove mention of language spoken in the Matrix room, we are using English now.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debian-curl-now-supports-http3/","title":"Debian's curl now supports HTTP3"},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/hello-world/":{"body":"This is my very first post, just to make sure everything is working as expected.\nMade with Zola and the Abridge theme.\n","description":"","id":"https://samueloph.dev/blog/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"},"https://samueloph.dev/images/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://samueloph.dev/images/","title":""},"https://samueloph.dev/pages/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://samueloph.dev/pages/","title":""},"https://samueloph.dev/slides/":{"body":"Fixing CVEs on Debian: Everything you probably know already\nsamueloph_slides_2024_07_fixing_cves_on_debian.pdf\n\n    \n\nThe secret sauce of Debian\nsamueloph_slides_2024_08_the_secret_sauce_of_debian.pdf\n\n    \n\n\"I use Debian BTW\"\nsamueloph_slides_2024_08_i_use_debian_btw.pdf\n\n    \n\nwcurl - one year later\nsamueloph_slides_2025_07_wcurl_one_year_later.pdf\nA Segurança do Debian\nsamueloph_slides_2025_05_a_seguranca_do_debian.pdf\nThe Security of Debian - An Introduction for Advanced Users\nsamueloph_slides_2025_07_the_security_of_debian.pdf\n","description":"","id":"https://samueloph.dev/slides/","title":"Slides"}},"docInfo":{"https://samueloph.dev/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://samueloph.dev/about/":{"body":98,"description":0,"title":0},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/announcing-wcurl-a-curl-wrapper-to-download-files/":{"body":844,"description":0,"title":6},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debconf24-was-fun/":{"body":570,"description":0,"title":7},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debian-13-my-list-of-exciting-new-features/":{"body":948,"description":0,"title":6},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/debian-curl-now-supports-http3/":{"body":656,"description":0,"title":5},"https://samueloph.dev/blog/hello-world/":{"body":12,"description":0,"title":2},"https://samueloph.dev/images/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://samueloph.dev/pages/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://samueloph.dev/slides/":{"body":30,"description":0,"title":1}},"length":11},"lang":"English"}
